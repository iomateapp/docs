## How IOmate works?

IOmate is an open source Saas created to build, execute and manage RPA (Robotic Proccess Automation)


## Applications Suite
The iomate is made by three main projects:

- [API](https://github.com/iomateapp/api): API built in python based on [AWS Serverless Services](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) architecture, which provides data management and socket connection with [robot](https://github.com/iomateapp/robot) devices.
- [STUDIO](https://github.com/iomateapp/studio): Frontend application built with [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) designed for managing the application data and building the automations that will be executed by the robot device.
- [ROBOT](https://github.com/iomateapp/robot): Desktop application that executes requests from api related to automations
